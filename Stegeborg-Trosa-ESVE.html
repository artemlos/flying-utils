    <h3>Planning</h3>
    <p>The route to Stegeborg from Trosa was planned as a straight line with minor correction to avoid the Skavsta CTR in case it would take time to get clearance
        to C airspace. My plan was to fly at ca 3000ft and then descend once I was close to Stegeborg. The entire route to Stegeborg and back was on a flight plan.
    </p>

    <p>The starting airfield is Trosa/Troslanda and the destination is Stegeborg (ESVE), with the following route used as the flight plan: </p>
    <pre style="background-color: lightgray;">

Destination ZZZZ 5826N01636</pre>
    <h3>Outcome</h4>

        <p><strong>Journey to Stegeborg (ESVE)</strong></p>
    <p>
       The route to Stegeborg was very smooth. I got delayed due to other aircrafts taking off as well as the fact that the flight plan required me to enter the coordinates to Stegeborg; it was not enough to just write ESVE.
       After take off and right turn towards Stegeborg, I activated the flight plan and requested clearance to controled airspace
       at 3000ft. Östgöta Approach gave me the clearance to 3000ft and below, and emphasised that I can fly on lower altitudes up to 3000ft. 
       The view below was amazing and you could see the archipelago with all the small islands.
    </p>
    <p>
        The journey took around 30 min, and during this time I kept monitoring the instruments and mentally preparing for landing. I was also learning how to use
        the built in GPS for future routes. However, at this point I felt more comfortable using the paper map since this is what Björn and I practised so much during flight training.
        I feel that the GPS can be a good secondary source, however, it's important to know where you are on the paper map as the primary means of navigating.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Once close to Stegeborg, Östgöta Approach made me descend to below 1600ft and I was allowed to leave the frequency to the one used by Stegeborg Radio.
        I knew that there were no aircrafts in the vicinity of the airfield and I kept sending my intentions. After checking the wind direction, 
        I attempted the landing several times but were too high on final. Although I could have attempted a sideslip, I felt that since it was a late evening, it's better
        to just overfly the field and attempt the landing again. After several attempts I landed on runway <strong>07</strong>.

    <p>
        After closing the flight plan and submitting a new one, I parked the plane and tried to find the castle ruins, since I still had some time left.
    </p>
<p><strong>Journey back to Trosa/Troslanda</strong></p>
    <p>
       The journey back was on a flight plan as well and I requested 3000ft at first with a descent to 2000ft closer to Trosa, to avoid Stockholm TMA. Similar to the journey to Stegeborg,
       the air was calm and in Trosa it was windstill.

    <h3>Learning outcomes</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>It's good idea to be on time to the airfield and try to preserve your "stress battery".</li>
        <li>Right traffic patterns are more difficult, especially if you don't have windows in the back. Next time, I want to try to mark out the traffic pattern
            in advance, i.e. where to turn base and where to turn final, especially if one of the runways uses right traffic pattern.
        </li>
        <li>If the flight is on flight plan, I think it's better to file it in advance. This ensures that you can be assured that it will be accepted by the system. For example,
            in my case, I was delayed since the destination airport was not recognized.
        </li>
        <li>Add more fuel for taxiing and take-off in the operational flight plan if you anticipate delays. Especially if it's first time at the destination airfield.</li>
    </ol>
