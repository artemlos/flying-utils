    <h3>Planning</h3>
    <p>The route to Västervik was planned as a straight line with minor correction to keep closer to coast line. 
    </p>

    <p><img src="img/Västervik1.png" style="width:30%;"></p>

    <p>The starting airfield is Trosa/Troslanda and the destination is Västervik (ESSW), with the following route used as the flight plan: </p>
    <pre style="background-color: lightgray;">
DCT 5829N01659E DCT
DEP 5854N01730E
Destination ESSW</pre>
    <h3>Outcome</h4>

    <p><strong>Journey to Västervik (ESSW)</strong></p>

   <p> The journey to Västervik was in smooth air with helpful support form ATC the entire way. Landing there was more tricky since it either was
    very gusty or the trees caused turbulence. In any way, reducing flaps to 2 instead of 3 solved the issue.

    <h3>Learnings</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In gusty conditions, it seems to work better to approach a bit faster and use less flaps. When doing so, the flare will be longer
        and you have to be careful with the nose since slight upward movement will cause the plane to go up again (possibly due to speed). When touching down with the wheels,
        putting the flaps away seem to help to stop the plane (I assume since there is less lift produced by the wings).
      </li>
      <li>If you are used to narrower runways, it may feel like you are too low on a wider runway.</li>
    </ol>
